Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Project Name: Mybabybridge
Platforms: Android & iOS
Core Objective: Deliver a native-like mobile app experience for the existing web app https://mybabybridge-benefit-platform.vercel.app/ using Flutter.
1. Overview
Purpose

Create a Flutter-based mobile app that:

    Embeds the existing web app via a WebView.

    Provides native app features (splash screen, loaders, offline support).

    Enhances user experience with platform-specific UI/UX patterns.

Target Audience

    Couples looking for fertility treatments by using BabyBridge benefits.

Key Success Metrics

    90%+ of users rate the app as "smooth and native-like."

    <1% crash rate post-launch.

    Load time <2 seconds for initial WebView content.

2. Project Scope
In Scope

    WebView integration with existing URL.

    Splash screen, loader, and error handling.

    Offline detection and retry mechanisms.

    Basic device feature access (e.g., camera for web form uploads).

    Platform-specific UI navigation (e.g., Android back button).

    Material 3 (Android) and Cupertino (iOS) design system integration.

Out of Scope

    Modifying the core web app functionality.

    Advanced native features (e.g., AR, Bluetooth).

    Deep linking to external content.

4. Detailed Requirements
A. Splash Screen

    Design: Platform-specific (iOS: Cupertino minimalism, Android: Material 3).

    Duration: 2 seconds or until WebView initializes.

    Implementation: Use flutter_launcher_icons plugin.

B. Loader & Initialization

    Show a circular progress indicator while WebView loads.

    Handle timeout (30 seconds max) with a retry button.

C. WebView Configuration

    Package: webview_flutter (with hybrid composition for Android performance).

    Features:

        JavaScript enabled.

        Navigation restricted to the original domain (prevent external links).

        Custom error page for HTTP 404/500 errors.

D. Offline Support

    Use connectivity_plus to detect network status.

    Show a custom offline screen with a "Retry" button.

    Cache a lightweight error page locally.

E. Navigation Controls

    Android Back Button: Navigate WebView history or exit app.

    iOS Swipe Back: Implement custom gesture detection if needed.

    Pull-to-Refresh: Reload WebView content.

F. Security

    SSL pinning for the WebView domain.

    Block third-party cookies.

G. UI/UX

    Android: Use Material 3 design system for all native UI elements (buttons, cards, typography, color schemes).

    iOS: Use Cupertino widgets and design patterns for a native look and feel.

5. Testing Strategy
Functional Testing

    WebView load success/failure scenarios.

    Navigation controls (back button, swipe gestures).

    Offline retry flow.

Performance Testing

    Measure WebView load time on 3G/4G/Wi-Fi.

    Monitor memory usage during prolonged use.

Security Testing

    Validate SSL pinning and cookie policies.

    Penetration testing for WebView vulnerabilities.

UX Testing

    User surveys for "native feel" perception.

    Heatmaps for touch interactions.

6. Deployment

    iOS: App Store compliance (ensure WebView content adheres to Apple guidelines).

    Android: Optimize APK size with ProGuard/R8.

    Monitoring: Firebase Crashlytics for real-time crash reports.
